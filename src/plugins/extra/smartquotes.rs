//! Replaces `"` and `'` quotes with "nicer" ones like `‘`, `’`, `“`, `”`, or
//! with `’` for words like "isn't".
//!
//! This currently only supports single character quotes, which is a limitation
//! of the Rust implementation due to the use of `const` generics.
//!
//! ## Implementation notes
//!
//! The main obstacle to implementing this was the fact that the document is
//! necessarily represented as a tree of nodes.
//! Each node is thus necessarily referenced by its parents, which means that an
//! any given moment we cannot hold a mutable reference to a node if any other
//! part of the code holds a reference to the document. At least that's my
//! understanding of the problem.
//! The smartquotes algorithm from the JS library makes heavy use of iteration
//! backwards and forwards through a flat list of tokens. This isn't really
//! possible in the Rust implementation. Building a flat representation of all
//! `Node` objects is easy, but holding that list precludes us from executing a
//! `root.walk_mut` call at the same time.
//! On top of that, while the smartquotes algorithm iterates linearly over all
//! nodes/tokens, looking at a specific token with index `j` can trigger
//! replacements in any of the tokens with `0` to `j - 1`.
//!
//! The solution proposed here is to first compute all the replacement
//! operations on a read-only flat view of the document, and _then_ to perform
//! all replacements in a single call to `root.walk_mut`.
